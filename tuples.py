#Tuples are data structures. Containers where we can store different values.
#Very Similar to lists, but with some differences
#Tuples are inmutable, they can't be modified after created

coordinates = (4, 5) #tuples go between parenthesis. 
print(coordinates[0])

list_of_coordinates = [(3, 5), (4, 4), (7, 123), (0, 1234)] #list can be modified but not it's tuples
